# Laravel Vue Auth Boilerplate

## Local Setup (Docker Optional)
```
cd laravel_vue_auth_boilerplate
cp example.env .env
cp docker-compose.yml.example docker-compose.yml
```

Tweak any settings in the docker-compose.yml, like database values.

If using Docker, spin up container (assumes you have docker desktop running):
```
docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```

Run the following commands to install dependencies:

Locally:
```
composer install
```

or using a container:
```
docker run --rm --interactive --tty \
  --volume $PWD:/app \
  composer install
```

Locally:
```
npm install
```

or

from your container:
```
docker-compose exec php npm install
```

Locally:
```
php artisan key:generate
```

or

from your container:
```
docker-compose exec php php artisan key:generate
```

set up your database and update the following lines in .env file (this assumes a mysql db):
```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE={ WHATEVER YOU NAMED YOUR SCHEMA }
DB_USERNAME={ YOUR USERNAME }
DB_PASSWORD={ YOUR PASSWORD }
```

For Docker you should match these values to the variables you use in the MySQL environment variables from your `docker-compose.yml`


run the migrations, seed db with admin, add passport tables (this gives you client (vue) token):
```
docker-compose exec php php artisan migrate
docker-compose exec php php artisan db:seed
docker-compose exec php php artisan passport:install
```

This will generate two keys, copy the 'secret' for id=2 (Laravel Password Grant Client) - this was created by passport:install, above, and is needed for Vue to connect.  Then paste the following lines in `.env` file, using that 'secret':

```
PASSPORT_LOGIN_ENDPOINT = 'localhost:8000'
PASSPORT_CLIENT_ID={ Client ID }
PASSPORT_CLIENT_SECRET={ THE 'SECRET' OF LARAVEL PASSWORD GRANT CLIENT }
```

Once you've updated these values you can then run:

```
docker-compose exec php npm run live
```

This will first run through some compilation processes and then you'll be ready to run.

The project will be running on `localhost:8000`

You will need to get a user name from the database. Use the username and 'password' to login, you'll be taken to dashboard and adopt your next dog or cat from your local shelter or rescue group, please and thank you.
